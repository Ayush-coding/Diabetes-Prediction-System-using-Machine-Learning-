# Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning–based prediction system that analyzes patient health data and predicts the likelihood of diabetes. It uses popular ML algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and a simple UI (CLI/Web) to help users obtain early insights for healthcare decision-making.

# Features
Utilizes multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature selection)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Confusion matrix & ROC curve visualization
Easy-to-use Python script / Streamlit or Flask web app (optional)
Clean and modular project structure

# Dataset
This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes health parameters such as:
Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age

# Technologies & Tools
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Streamlit / Flask (optional)
# Model Performance
The system evaluates different models and selects the best one based on performance metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
